# Rocketseat - Dev Finances ( [Click Here]( https://samueloliveiraa.github.io/dev-finances/) )

![Design preview for Dev Finances](/Assets/Images/design-preview.png)

## WELCOME! ðŸ‘‹

This project was proposed by [Mayk Brito](https://github.com/maykbrito) at the [Rocketseat Discover Marathon](https://www.rocketseat.com.br/discover), the design was done by [Tiago Luchtenberg](https://www.instagram.com/tiagoluchtenberg/?hl=pt-br) and the code was done by me. I tried to follow the design as close as possible to the one proposed by Tiago and the code tried to make it as lean and clean as possible, but I will refactor the code later to make it even leaner and more readable
