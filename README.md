## WELCOME! üëã

This is the last challenge proposed by **[Iuri Code](https://github.com/iuricode)** in the **[Codel√¢ndia](https://discord.com/channels/327861810768117763/384757111873077248)** comunity there at discord, where 10 Front-end challenges were proposed, ranging from basic to intermediate. And as this was the last challenge, I decided to do my best and give it my all, so I didn't just do the front-end of the application, but I used the **Node.Js** technology to apply the technique called web-scraping, which dynamically picks up the news from the site **[Ei Nerd](https://www.einerd.com.br/)** and at updates daily.

## The Challenge üéØ

This was my first time using Node.Js in a project, so everything for me was a great learning experience and also a great challenge, but I loved every second of this project and also intend to add new features to the project in the future, maybe a bank of data
